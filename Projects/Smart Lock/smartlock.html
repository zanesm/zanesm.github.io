							<li><b>About:</b> This project smart door lock created using an Arduino Uno R4, RFID
								scanner, RFID badge, servo motor, and a slide bolt latch. Code for the project was
								written in C++.
								The project begins with the LCD screen prompting the user to scan their RFID badge for
								authentication. The user then scans the badge, and if they have valid credentials, this
								will
								trigger the servo motor to rotate, which slides the bolt on the lock over. The door will
								stay unlocked for several seconds, then automatically relock.
								If the user has invalid credentials, the LCD screen will output a message notifying the
								user that access has been denied, and the servo motor will do nothing.
								Furthermore, the user is able to access the controls of the lock via a web page. he web
								page allows the user to unlock the door remotely. After unlocking, the system
								automatically relocks the door after a few seconds

							<li><b>Project Requirements: </b> "In this final project, you are asked to develop a
								complete IoT application system with wireless smart
								object(s) including about 3-5 sensors/actuators not including temperature sensor, which
								includes the
								system design, implementation, application, and result analysis. You should demonstrate
								your
								developed system at your presentation. "</li>

						<p><b>Lessons Learned: </b></p>
						<ul>
							<li>How to design and implement a complete IoT system from scratch, combining hardware and
								software to achieve a practical real-world solution.</li>
							<li>How to manage wireless communication between IoT devices and a central server, enabling
								remote control and monitoring.</li>
							<li>How to bridge the gap between theoretical IoT concepts and their practical application
								in real-world systems.</li>
							<li>How to ensure system reliability by handling edge cases, such as network disconnections
								or incorrect RFID scans, within the code.</li>
							<li> How to use the HTTP protocol for communication between a web client and a
								microcontroller, expanding the system's functionality beyond local control.</li>
							<li>How to use libraries to simplify hardware interaction, such as MFRC522 for RFID
								functionality and LiquidCrystal for display management.</li>
							<li> How to design a user-friendly interface for interacting with an IoT device, using an
								LCD screen and buttons to provide feedback and control options.</li>
