							<li><b>About:</b> This project was designed to replicate the functions of Twitter. Upon
								starting the application, the GUI prompts users to log in.
								If they do not have an account, they are then able to create one. Once logged in, users
								are able find others to connect with and follow them, by searching for a specific user,
								or viewing all users on the platform.
								Furthermore, users are able to make posts, or edit posts they have already made.
								Additional features allow for users to like a post, or look at a "feed" view that
								displays new posts from people they follow. The program
								also features an admin menu, allowing for the admin to delete users or posts, or edit
								user information, such as passwords. The program was written in Java during my
								second semester with IUPUI. User data is stored in an SQL database. </li>
							<li><b>Course:</b> Computing 2</li>
							<li><b>Project Requirements: </b> "Create a project that illustrates what you've done this
								semester. You have quite a bit of leeway on this project, so pick something interesting.
								Ideal projects will illustrate the primary ideas of this course:
								<br> - Object-oriented programming
								<br>- Inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism
								<br>- Sound programming practices
								<br>- Solid documentation including (but not limited to) UML diagrams
								<br>- Proper implementation of Abstraction (interfaces, abstract classes)
								<br>- Appropriate use of data structures (linked lists, stacks, arraylists) "
							</li>
							<li><b>Grade:</b> 94/100</li>
						</ul>
					</div>

					<div>
						<p><b>Lessons Learned: </b></p>
						<ul>
							<li>Gained hands-on experience with object-oriented design principles, including
								inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.</li>
							<li>Developed a deeper understanding of how to establish and manage database connections
								using SQL to store and retrieve user data.</li>
							<li>Improved Java Swing knowledge by creating a functional and responsive user interface for
								the social media app.</li>
							<li>Learned how to handle user input and interaction effectively, ensuring the program
								responds to user actions such as logging in, creating accounts, and posting.</li>
							<li>Refined debugging skills by troubleshooting issues related to the database, GUI
								responsiveness, and user interactions.</li>
							<li>Created clear and concise documentation for the project, including UML diagrams and
								detailed explanations of code functionality.</li>
							<li>Learned to write modular and maintainable code, ensuring the program can be easily
								extended for additional features in the future.</li>
							<li>Gained experience with implementing data persistence to store user data securely and
								reliably across different sessions.</li>
						</ul>
						<p><b>** Please note:</b> The video above does not fully depict the final version of the project
							that was submitted for a grade. I lost access to the original database and had to recreate
							it from memory, so some features may not be shown correctly in the video version. <b>**</b>
