								<li><b>About:</b> A two part capstone project created while working at Five Star. Both
									portions of the project were used to effectively showcase how my Computer Science
									degree has equipped me with the tools and knowledge to design and implement
									innovative solutions to real-world problems.

									<br><br><b>PART ONE:</b> The first portion involved implementing and configuring a
									PoE (Power over Ethernet) security camera system. This part was more IT-focused and
									included planning, hardware installation, network configuration, and system testing.
									The goal was to design and deploy a modern, secure camera network that improved
									monitoring and integrated smoothly with the school district's existing IT
									infrastructure.

									<br><br><b>PART TWO:</b> The second part involved designing and developing a
									lightweight facial recognition system using a Raspberry Pi and a camera module. The
									system leveraged Python and OpenCV for facial detection and recognition. I also
									built a GUI that allows users to register or remove individuals from the database.
									Additional functionality was added to send alerts when an unknown face is detected
									and to log attendance automatically.

						<p><b>Lessons Learned:</b></p>
						<ul>
							<li>Gained hands-on experience with real-world hardware and networking, including PoE setup,
								VLAN configuration, and MAC-based authentication.</li>
							<li>Improved problem-solving skills through troubleshooting hardware issues, IP conflicts,
								and mislabeled cabling in a live environment.</li>
							<li>Developed a practical understanding of deploying security-focused camera systems that
								integrate into existing IT infrastructure.</li>
							<li>Enhanced Python development skills, particularly in image processing, GUI design, and
								modular coding for facial recognition systems.</li>
							<li>Learned to implement machine learning concepts using OpenCV and face-recognition
								libraries in a constrained embedded environment (Raspberry Pi).</li>
							<li>Strengthened UI/UX design skills by building an intuitive GUI that could be used by
								non-technical users for facial recognition tasks.</li>
							<li>Applied time-delay logic and real-time video processing to solve real-world alerting and
								system noise challenges.</li>
							<li>Recognized and addressed limitations in scalability and facial recognition accuracy,
								especially with user name collisions and larger datasets.</li>
							<li>Connected classroom learning in networking, biometrics, HCI, and IoT to tangible
								deliverables with measurable security impact.</li>
